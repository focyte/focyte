- Hi, I’m John @Focyte
- A research scientist with 15+ years laboratory experience in the fields of [cancer, immunology, and RNA biology](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dy0vQoMAAAAJ&hl=en)
- Recently, I started using R to process and analyse data
- Through collaborations with data scientists I have also tried some feature selection methods and machine learning
- The next steps for me are to:
- 1. Become comfortable working with Linux command line and bash scripts
- 2. Learn to code in Python so I can further explore machine learning tools
- 3. Refresh my mathematics knowledge
