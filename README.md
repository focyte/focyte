- Hi, I’m John @Focyte
- I am a research scientist with 15+ years laboratory experience including cancer and immunology
- Recently, I started using R to process and analyse data
- Through collaborations with data scientists I have also tried some feature selection methods
- The next steps for me are to learn to code in Python and to refresh my mathematics knowledge
